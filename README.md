# terraform-graph

This program consumes Terraform state files and generates GXML files readable by [yEd](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed). 
The generated graphs are intended to be loaded in yEd and resaved in yEd's native format after layout.

## Caveat emptor

This is my first attempt at a Clojure proram. It's probably full of bugs and non-idomatic.
